rpgdb
=====

rpgdb is a small program built with `TinyDB <https://tinydb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
I made it for personal use to help keep track of various table-top role-playing games I'm
interested in. If you find it useful, that's good too.

To do
-----

* Build a better parser to allow for more flexible syntax
* Add option to allow chosing between pretty-printed and raw JSON output
* Add tests to improve maintainablity
* Add more documentation on usage
